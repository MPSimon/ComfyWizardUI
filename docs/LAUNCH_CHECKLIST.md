# Launch Checklist (Reddit/X)

## Must-have before posting

- [ ] Real Discord invite configured (done in code)
- [ ] Waitlist destination is canonical (`/waitlist/alt`)
- [ ] Waitlist data persistence enabled (`/.data/waitlist-store.json` writable on host)
- [ ] UTM links prepared for each channel/post
- [ ] Quickstart copy is non-placeholder
- [ ] Lint/test/build pass in CI

## Suggested launch metrics

- Landing views
- CTA clicks
- Signup submits
- Discord join clicks
- Conversion rate per source/campaign

## UTM template

Use links like:
`https://yourdomain.com/waitlist/alt?funnel=install&utm_source=x&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=launch_week1&utm_content=post_a`

## 7-day rollout

1. Day 1: launch post on X + first Reddit post
2. Day 2-3: reply to comments, capture objections
3. Day 4: post revised angle based on objections
4. Day 5-7: share proof/update + second Reddit thread

## Go/No-Go signal

- Continue if signup quality and Discord activation trend up week-over-week.
- Pause and revise if CTR is high but signup completion remains low.

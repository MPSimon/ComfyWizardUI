# Internal Business Notes (Not for Customer Pages)

This file stores internal planning/context removed from public-facing UI copy.

## Product Direction
- Free-first ComfyUI workflow hub.
- Focus on dependency-aware install paths.
- Audience segments tracked internally: creators and workflow users.

## Validation Direction
- Traction-first approach before deep build.
- Waitlist funnel messaging tests around:
  - 1-click install workflows with dependencies
  - workflow hub discovery and sharing
- Community activation centered around Discord onboarding.

## Internal Metrics (Working)
- Waitlist conversion rates by funnel.
- Discord join/activation signals.
- Install-intent click-through.

## UI Policy
- Keep customer pages outcome-focused.
- Do not expose internal validation targets, funnel experiment framing, or investor/operator jargon in public UI.

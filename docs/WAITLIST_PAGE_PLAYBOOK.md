# Waitlist Page Playbook (Evidence + Frameworks)

## Purpose
Define what a high-converting waitlist page should include for ComfyWizardUI and why.

## What should be on the page

1. One clear above-the-fold promise
- State one specific outcome in plain language.
- Avoid multiple competing headlines.

2. Strong hero + immediate CTA
- Big headline, supporting line, and one primary action.
- Keep first screen focused on one conversion goal.

3. Problem-to-outcome framing
- Show current pain and what changes after signup.
- Keep this concrete and measurable where possible.

4. Low-friction form with meaningful segmentation
- Ask only fields needed for validation.
- For this product: role + current stack are required to qualify demand.

5. Proof + progress
- Show traction indicators (signups, activated testers, goal).
- Repeat CTA after proof blocks.

6. Simple objection handling
- Why now, who this is for, what happens next.
- Keep copy short and direct.

7. Instrumentation for decisions
- Track full funnel from page view to activation.
- Compare message angles by conversion and activation quality.

## How this maps to your inspiration set

### Evan Spiegel lens
- Simplicity and cognitive clarity in the primary path.

### Russell Brunson lens
- Funnel stage discipline: view -> click -> signup -> join -> activate.

### Alex Hormozi lens
- Value-forward offer framing: pain removed and desired outcome.

### Elon Musk 5-step lens
1. challenge requirements
2. delete
3. simplify
4. speed up
5. automate after proven demand

### Gary Vee lens
- High-frequency distribution and feedback loops from real audience response.

### Y Combinator lens
- Talk to users early and do manual onboarding before scaling systems.

- Inspiration frameworks are applied as strategic synthesis, not quoted as direct book excerpts.
- Conversion quality matters more than raw waitlist volume for this stage.

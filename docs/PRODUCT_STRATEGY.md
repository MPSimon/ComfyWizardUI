# ComfyWizardUI Product Strategy

## What it is
ComfyWizardUI is a ComfyUI workflow hub with a dependency-aware install path.

## What it is not (yet)
- Not a paid workflow marketplace at launch.
- Not a managed GPU hosting platform.
- Not a full ComfyUI replacement.

## Who it is for
- Creators who want to share workflows with explicit dependencies.
- Users who want to install workflows on fresh ComfyUI/RunPod setups.
- ComfyUI users of all levels: beginner, power user, creator.

## Core jobs-to-be-done
1. Publish workflows with clear dependency requirements.
2. Discover trustworthy workflows quickly.
3. Reduce setup friction with one-click-install intent.
4. Move from empty setup to usable workflow faster.

## North-star and stage metrics
- Phase 1 NSM: active Discord testers.
- Target: 100 active Discord testers in 30 days.
- Supporting metrics:
  - waitlist conversion rate by funnel
  - install-intent click rate
  - Discord activation rate after signup

## Roadmap
1. Phase 1: waitlist validation and messaging test.
2. Phase 2: install flow proof with dependency-aware setup.
3. Phase 3: uploader + sharing loop.
4. Phase 4: creator monetization experiments.

## Non-negotiables
- Straightforward UX with one primary action.
- Transparent dependency visibility.
- Open-source feeling and BYO infrastructure.
- Build only what demand validates.
